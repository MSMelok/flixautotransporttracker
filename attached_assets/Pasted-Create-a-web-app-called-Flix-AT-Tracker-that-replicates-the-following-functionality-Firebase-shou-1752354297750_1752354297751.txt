Create a web app called "Flix AT Tracker" that replicates the following functionality, Firebase should be integrated for Auth and Firestore.

ðŸ“¦ FEATURES TO BUILD:
ðŸ”¹ 1. Firebase Integration
Use the following Firebase config:

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyCAPbba0CQ54YQwxKHaRjc3YduOYTtyhFM",
  authDomain: "flixautotransporttracker.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "flixautotransporttracker",
  storageBucket: "flixautotransporttracker.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "466490737243",
  appId: "1:466490737243:web:296943f60491349f86357e"
};
Use Firebase Authentication (Email/Password).

Use Firestore to store orders under the orders collection -- the collection in Firebase Database is called orders.

Add userId to each order (must match auth.currentUser.uid).

ðŸ”¹ 2. User Roles Logic
admin@admin.com can read/write all orders 

All other users can only read and write their own orders

admin@admin.com is the only one who can filter by user

Firestore rules will enforce this â€” use auth.currentUser.email to conditionally show admin controls.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Order Form
The form should collect:

Order Status (select: Posted, On Hold, In Progress, Dispatched, Completed, Canceled)

Order ID

Customer Name

Phone Number

Pickup Start (date)

Pickup End (date)

Dispatch Day (date)

Booking Date (date)

Broker Fee (number)

Total Price (number)

âœ… Use YYYY-MM-DD format for all date values
âœ… Store and compare dates as plain strings, not JavaScript Date objects, to fix the timezone bug

ðŸ”¹ 4. Dashboard Statistics
Split into 3 sections:

ðŸ“Š SECTION A â€“ Orders Info
Count per status

Cancellation % (Canceled Ã· Total Orders Ã— 100)

ðŸŽ¯ SECTION B â€“ Target Progress
Sum of brokerFee from Completed and Dispatched orders in selected 2-week range

Remaining to target: $2300 - brokerFeeSum

ðŸ’° SECTION C â€“ Salary Calculation

if (brokerFeeSum >= 2300)
  salary = 250 + (0.10 Ã— brokerFeeSum)
else
  salary = 0.20 Ã— brokerFeeSum
ðŸ”¹ 5. Date Range Filter
Let user pick a startDate and endDate

Only use Completed and Dispatched orders within this range in calculations

Use onAuthStateChanged() to guard protected routes
